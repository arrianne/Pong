<h1>PONG</h1>

As a way of better understanding game logic I decided to create the classic game 'Pong'.

I found this tutorial

Here is my final result:

Background

It introduced me to 'Processing', a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.
It started in 2001 and originally built on top of the programming language, Java. A future conversation led to the question of 'What language would you pick if processing was being invented today?' This was answered by Lauren Mccarthy, who began a project in collaboration with the Processing foundation to make the javascript the main language. - P5.js was born.

P5.js is a beginner friendly environment that enhances creative expression through programming. It is a simple way for Designers and artist to display their creativity in the browser. p5.js has a full set of drawing functionalities which makes it easy to translate a sketch.

Successes

p5.js was useful in quickly helping me to create a canvas and get the visuals of 'Pong' started, giving me more time to focus on my main goal of better understanding the logic of the game.

Here's an example of how simple it was to create the two main shapes of this game:

```
rect(20, p1, 10, 100);
ellipse(ball1.x, ball1.y, 20);

```

I believe the process of using p5.js helped me familiarise myself more with the syntax and will help my progression in writing native JS.
